# Running divisive clustering analysis in STATA
```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(Statamarkdown)
stataexe="C:/VApps/Stata_SE/15/StataSE-64.exe"
knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=stataexe,comment="")
```

Similar to R and Python, we need to first import the dataset into STATA. We use the "import delimited" command. \
```{stata, results="hide"}
import delimited "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anranmg/project506/master/BlackFriday.csv"
```
We only use information in "product_category_1" for clustering analysi considered too many missing values in another two categories. In our clustering model, we use customer preference, defined as relative expense in each product category, to help identify market segments. Meanwhile, we use some of the remaining geo-demographic attribututes to profile the clusters. Therefore, we later reshaped the dataset to the wide format and obtain 18 different variables.  \
```{stata, results="hide"}
reshape wide all_purchase, i(user_id) j(product_category_1)
```

To gain a overview of our consumer's shopping preference, we use summarize command. 
```{stata}
use project_result
summarize all_purchase*
```


Since our goal is to group customer based on how similiar taste they have for shopping, we use correlation distance measure as well as ward linkage method.
For simplicity, we use the Calinski Harabasz method to choose no. of clusters. Based on that, we finally use 2-segments solution and the segmentation result is shown as following. \
```{stata}
use project_result
tab group
```


We also plot a line chart to compare difference between groups: 

* it is apparent that compared with group one, customers in group two spend much more in category 1 while
they are less likely attracted by products in category 5 and 8. Based on these results, the company
could set tailored promotion strategy on these two groups of people.

Combined demographic features, we use the following plots to help detect divergence among these two clusters: 

* No big difference in age or residence structure among these two groups

* However, if we look at the percent of occupation, there are some interesting findings:

- for example, for people with job 2, they are more likely to be gathered in group one. In other words, they would be more likely to be attracted by products in category 5 and 8. Thus, the company could make customerized ads for these workers. 

- Similar conclusion can also applied to job 20.
