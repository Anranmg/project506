##Model Introduction 

[Ward's method](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/08/lecture-08.pdf/ 'ward')
 says that the distance between two clusters, A and B, is how
much the sum of squares will increase when we merge them:
$$
\Delta(A,B) = \sum_{i\in A \bigcup B} ||\overrightarrow{x_i} - \overrightarrow{m}_{A \bigcup B}||^2 - \sum_{i \in A}||\overrightarrow{x_i} - \overrightarrow{m}_A||^2 -\sum_{i \in B}||\overrightarrow{x_i}- \overrightarrow{m}_B||^2 
= \frac{n_An_B}{n_A+n_B} ||\overrightarrow{m}_A- \overrightarrow{m}_B||^2
$$ 

where $\overrightarrow{m}_j$is the center of cluster j, and $n_j$ is the number of points in it. $\Delta$ is called the merging cost of combining the clusters A and B.
With hierarchical clustering, the sum of squares starts out at zero (because every point is in its own cluster) and then grows as we merge clusters. Wardâ€™s method keeps this growth as small as possible.

The [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance/ 'Euclidean distance') is the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.

$$
d(p,q) = d(q,p) = \sqrt{(q_1 -p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + \cdots + (q_n -p_n)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1} (q_i-p_i)^2}
$$
